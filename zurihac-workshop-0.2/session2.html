# 🖧 Server-side `network-simple`

Let's practice signature-reading skills

.code70[
```haskell
serve
  :: MonadIO m
  => HostPreference
  -- ^ Host to bind.
  -> ServiceName
  -- ^ Server service port to bind.
  -> ((Socket, SockAddr) -> IO ())
  -- ^ Computation to run in a different thread
  --   once an incoming connection is accepted.
  -> m a -- ^ This function never returns.
```
]

---

# 🖧 Server-side `network-simple`

`serve` takes care of:

- Listening all the time at the given port
- Whenever a new connection request comes <br/> 1️⃣ accept it, <br /> 2️⃣ **spawn a new thread**, <br /> 3️⃣ run the callback.

---

# ➿ `go` pattern

Once we accept, we go into an (infinite) _loop_

- Usually with a recursive `go` function

.code70[
```haskell
diceServer :: IO ()
diceServer = serve "*" "8080" $ \(skt, _) -> do
  -- initialization
  go skt
  where go :: Socket -> IO () 
        go skt = do
          -- read and parse request
          -- send a response
          go skt  -- and over again!
```
]

---

# 🖧 Server-side `network-simple`

Requests and responses are 64-bit numbers

.little-margin-top[.code70[
```haskell
go :: Socket -> IO ()
go skt = do
  -- read and parse request
  mayBytes <- recv skt 8
  case mayBytes of
    Nothing -> pure ()  -- done
    Just bytes -> do
      let Right max = decode @Word64 bytes
      response <- encode <$> randomRIO (0, max)
      -- send a response
      send skt response
      go skt  -- and over again!
```
]]

---

# 🏁 Recognizing end-of-connection

If `recv` returns nothing, we stop the loop

```haskell
go skt = do
  -- read and parse request
  mayBytes <- recv skt 8
  case mayBytes of
    Nothing -> pure ()  -- done
    Just bytes -> do
      ...
      go skt  -- and over again!
```

---

# 🔄 Serialization

Conversion to and from `ByteString`

- `cereal` for binary encoding
- `aeson` for JSON
- `avro` for Avro (used in Kafka)
- ...

---

# 🔄 Serialization

Users implement instances of some classes

- Just one, like `Serialize` in `cereal`
- Two, like `ToJSON` and `FromJSON`

And then conversion is provided by generic

```haskell
encode :: Serialize a {- or -} ToFormat a
       => a -> ByteString
decode :: Serialize a {- or -} FromFormat a
       => ByteString -> Either Error a
```

---

# 🪢 Type applications

Help the compiler to disambiguate types

```haskell
decode @Word64 bytes
```

Other possibility is `ScopedTypeVariables`

```haskell
connect
  :: (MonadIO m, MonadMask m)
  => HostName
  -- ^ Server hostname or IP address.
  -> ServiceName 
  -- ^ Server service port.
  -> ((Socket, SockAddr) -> m r)
  -- ^ Computation taking the communication
  --   socket and the server address.
  -> m r
```
]

# 🎲 One-person dice roll client

## .grey[🤔 How do I test this?] .font50[`serras.github.io/zurihac-workshop`]

.code60[
```haskell
$ cabal repl session2
> import DiceRoll
DiceRoll> diceServer
^C  -- use Ctrl + C to stop
```

```haskell
$ cabal repl session2
> import DiceRoll
DiceRoll> diceClient 6

DiceRoll> diceClient 10

```
]

---

# ‼️ Exceptions

You forget to start the server and...

```
> DiceRoll.diceClient 3
*** Exception: Network.Socket.connect: 
      <socket: 12>: does not exist
      (Connection refused)
```

## 😱 WAAAAAAT????

---

# ‼️ Exceptions

Haskell's `IO` runtime uses **exceptions**

- Network or connection problems
- File (or resource) not found
- and many more input/output problems

Even some built-in features use exceptions

- Pattern match failure
- `undefined` and `error`

---

# ⁉️ Dealing with exceptions

~~Use `Control.Exception` from `base`~~

🅰️ Use `Control.Exception.Safe` <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from `safe-exceptions`

🅱️ Use `UnliftIO.Exception` from `unliftio`

### .grey[All three provide the same API]

---

# ⁉️ Dealing with exceptions

If you want to perform some handling

```haskell
catch :: (MonadCatch m, Exception e)
      => m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a
```

If you want to "purify" the problem

```haskell
try :: (MonadCatch m, Exception e)
    => m a -> m (Either e a)
```

---

# ⁉️ Idiomatic usage of `catch`

.code70[
```haskell
diceClient :: Word64 -> IO (Maybe Word64)
diceClient n = 
  connect "127.0.0.1" "8080" (\(skt, _) -> do
    ...)
  `catch`
  (\(e :: IOException) -> pure Nothing)
```
]

- Use `catch` infix
- Use `ScopedTypeVariables` to indicate which exceptions are to be caught

---

# 🫅 Exception hierarchy

Exception types for a hierarchy

- The top is called `SomeException`

However, if you want to "swallow" all exceptions, better use

.code70[
```haskell
catchAny :: MonadCatch m
         => m a -> (SomeException -> m a) -> m a 
  tryAny :: MonadCatch m
         => m a -> m (Either SomeException a) 
```
]

---

# 🧰 Resource management

### .grey[Exception + laziness = 😵‍💫]

This makes resource management challenging <br /> (even more than usual)

🅰️ Use `resourcet` <br />
🅱️ Use `managed` <br />
➕ `resource-pool` to handle pools of resources

---

# 🎲 Dice roll and increment

### .grey[We want to extend the functionality]

How do we (de)serialize command and data?

1. Express them as data types
2. Implement `Serialize` instances

---

# 🎲 Dice roll and increment

### .grey[We want to extend the functionality]

How do we (de)serialize command and data?

1. Express them as data types

```haskell
data Request 
  = DiceRoll  { max    :: Word64 }
  | Increment { number :: Word64 }

type Response = Word64
```

---

# 🎲 Dice roll and increment

### .grey[We want to extend the functionality]

How do we (de)serialize command and data?

1. Express them as data types
2. ~~Implement `Serialize` instances~~

## Use automatic deriving!

---

# 🤖 Automatic deriving

Compiler writes instances for us

- `Eq`, `Show`, and others are built-in
- Extensible with the `Generic` mechanism

.code70[
```haskell
{-# language DeriveGeneric, DeriveAnyClass #-}

data Request 
  = DiceRoll  { max    :: Word64 }
  | Increment { number :: Word64 }
  deriving (Generic, Serialize)
```
]

---

# 🖧 Updated server-side

```haskell
let Right max = decode @Word64 bytes
response <- encode <$> randomRIO (1, max)
```

Deserialize with the new type

```haskell
let Right req = decode @Request bytes
response <- case req of
  DiceRoll max -> randomRIO (1, max)
  Increment n  -> pure (n + 1)
```

---

# 🖧 Updated server-side

```haskell
let Right max = decode @Word64 bytes
response <- encode <$> randomRIO (1, max)
```

Deserialize with the new type

```haskell
let Right req = decode bytes
response <- case req of
  DiceRoll max -> randomRIO (1, max)
  Increment n  -> pure (n + 1)
```

The type `Request` can be inferred

---

# 💬 Greeting

## .grey[🧑‍💻 Time for practice!] .font50[`serras.github.io/zurihac-workshop`]

Add a new command to say "hi!" to people

Make it as flexible as you want:

- Name of the person to be greeted
- Language
- Time of the day

## 🧵 Each player runs in a different thread

🪡 How to communicate across boundaries?

---

# 🪡 Communication across threads

~~Use `Control.Concurrent` from `base`~~

Use `stm` (Software Transactional Memory)

- Similar concept as in databases
- Transactions are isolated and atomic
    - One cannot read the dirty state of another

---

# 🪡 Software Transactional Memory

One cannot read the dirty state of another

```haskell
do v <- newTVarIO 0
   replicateM 3 $ async $  -- 3 threads
     atomically $ do       -- tx. boundary
       n <- readTVar v     --    ║
       writeTVar (n + 1)   --   ═╝
```

The end value of `v` is **guaranteed** to be 3

---

# ♻️ Server as state machine

When a user connects...

- If they send `NewGame`, send a `GameCode`
   - When the other player connects, </br> send `GameStarts`
- If they send `JoinGame` and the code
    - If the code exists, send `GameStarts`
    - Otherwise, send `GameNotFound` and close
- Otherwise, close the connection

---

# 🪡 Shared state

Dictionary (key-value map)

- Keys are `GameCode`s
- Values are the sockets

--

```haskell
crServer = do
  -- initialize shared state
  state <- newTVarIO @State Map.empty
  serve "127.0.0.1" "8080" $ \(skt, _) ->
    worker state skt

worker :: TVar State -> Socket -> IO ()
```

---

# 👷 Cloudy Rolly worker

Trick to avoid repeating `state` and `skt`

.code70[
```haskell
worker :: TVar State -> Socket -> IO ()
worker state skt = start
  where
    start = do
      ...

    newGame = ...
    joinGame code = ...

    play = putStrLn "play!"
```
]

---

# 👷 Cloudy Rolly worker

Wait for the first message to come

.little-margin-top[.code70[
```haskell
worker state skt = start
  where
    start = do
      Just req <- recvJson skt
      case req of
        NewGame -> newGame
        JoinGame code -> joinGame code
```

```haskell
-- read a line and deserialize
recvJson :: (MonadIO m, FromJSON a)
         => Socket -> m (Maybe a)
```
]
]

---

# 👷 Cloudy Rolly worker

.code60[
```haskell
worker state skt = start
  where
    newGame = do
      -- record ourselves in new code
      code <- randomCode
      atomically $
        modifyTVar state (Map.insert code [skt])
      sendJson skt (GameCode code)

      -- wait for the other message
      atomically $ do
        Just skts <- Map.lookup code <$> readTVar state
        check (length skts > 1)
      sendJson skt GameStarts
      
      -- go!
      play
```
]

---

# 🌀 Retry transactions

.code70[
```haskell
-- wait for the other message
atomically $ do
  Just skts <- Map.lookup code <$> readTVar state
  check (length skts > 1)
```
]

- `check` aborts the tx. if the condition is `False`
- The tx. is only retried when any `TVar` mentioned changes its value

### `TVar` works as a synchronization mechanism

---

# 👷 Cloudy Rolly worker

    joinGame code = do

# ☁️🎲 Cloudy Rolly

## .grey[🏠🧑‍💻 (No more) time for practice!]

### Finish the implementation of the server

1. Change `State` to represent on-going games
2. Use `TVar` as synchronization mechanism
3. Write a single `play` implementation

### Finish the implementation of the clients

# 🪡 STM-enabled data structures

Many users `==>` lots of contention

- Every `JoinGame` "wakes up" every `NewGame`
- But we only care about one code!

### More fine-grained data structures

.margin-top[
- `stm-containers` brings maps and sets
- `stm` includes unbounded queues
- `stm-chans` adds bounded queues

# 📋 Summary

### .grey[Lots of practice in the `IO` monad]

.margin-top[
- GHC uses exceptions for I/O errors
- High-level networking with `network-simple`
- Automatic deriving = <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serialization without the boilerplate
- `stm` for communication across threads
